                Eating healthily may be enjoyable, inexpensive, and simple. Making informed decisions is the key to
                developing a generally healthful eating pattern.

                A nutritious diet can, after all, help lower your risk of heart disease, stroke, and a host of other
                undesirable conditions. Fortunately, maintaining a healthy diet doesn't have to be difficult or mean
                giving up all of your favorite foods.
